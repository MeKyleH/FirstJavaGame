My Java Top Down Game New Additions To Come

Several files were created during writing and optimization hasn't been implemented yet. There may be lots of redundancy in files and possibly even unused classes (such as the RandomLevel class) due to their use only during testing. Also, I have not altered their folder paths in the code. If you would like an easy download with all of the organization and images please visig my website: http://www.whoiskyleholt.com/samplework.html for an easy .zip download.
